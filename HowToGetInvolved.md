I'm glad you're interested in contributing to Zombie, Run!  There are current needs for everything from game design, ui design, coding, graphics work, and testing.  If you are interested in any of those aspects, please email Peter at peterjdolan+zombierun@gmail.com for more information.

## To Start ##

Feel free to checkout the current code, which includes the multiplayer game server (to be run on Google AppEngine), the HTML for the zrli.org website, and the code for the Android game itself.  Dig around and see how messy things currently are, and drop Peter a note if you have any questions at all or want to start contributing some patches!

If you are new to AppEngine development you may want to start with our guide on [Setting up AppEngine](SetupAppengine.md) with Zombie, Run!

If you are new to android development you may want to start with our guide on [Setting up Eclipse](SetupEclipse.md) with Zombie, Run!  The Android application is currently stagnating as we reimplement the game in HTML on AppEngine.

Be sure you have read the [Development Guidelines](DevelopmentGuidelines.md) before you start coding!
